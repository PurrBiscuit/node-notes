# Simple Counter App With Redux

## Overview

A simple application that runs client side only.  The Redux javascript is retrieved from a CDN using a `script` tag in `index.html` -> `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/4.0.0-beta.1/redux.js`.

Configurations for the app's Redux store are made in the `js/apps.js` file.  This file also adds the event listeners and subscribes the counter value to the Redux store.
